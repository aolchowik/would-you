# Would You Rather Project

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. 
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. 
Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other 
people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

### Installation
1. Clone repository
2. run ```yarn install```

### Run Application

In the project directory, you should run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
